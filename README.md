>Project report on Github (readme file) Or Unity Teams:
Create a 3- to 5-minute video (mandatory) showing the use of your application with your voice over. That video should appear on the top of your github readme file. The video can be used as a backup during your presentation just in case of something go wrong.
Clearly explain the duties of each student in your group (if you work as a group).
Describe your application by screenshots (with meaningful captions) and text. Make sure you have the list and screenshots of models.
Links to all the source code and any assets (models, textures, sounds). Make sure you source code is well-commented.

# Introduction

Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that allows people to immerse themselves in any new world. It has become a new era of visualization technology recently with many applications in various fields such as gaming and education.
In this project, we develop **Skeletons** (\pic), a puzzle game aiming to educate players about the skeletal system using Oculus Rift.
Our aim is to provide an interactive and appealing educational application to facilitate learning about bones and the skeletal system.

# Demo

# Design Solution


First, we use Blender to create the bones (\pic). These individual bones are then used to design the game. The game is implemented with Unity. 

For this game, 

# Game descriptions
There are three difficulty levels in the game, namely Easy Mode, Medium Mode, and Hard Mode. At the welcome screen, the user can choose the mode from the Menu. The timer will start to count and be shown in the top right corner of the headset after the mode is chosen (\pic).

Easy Mode (\pic): **some descriptions go here**

Medium Mode (\pic): **some descriptions go here**

Hard Mode (\pic): **some descriptions go here**


# Team Contribution
- Make the bones 
- Set up Oculus Rift
- Set up Unity project
- Import the bones to Unity project
- Create the scene
- Implement logical functions 
- Make a demo video
- Write Report
- **TODO: add more**

# Conclusion
We implement a VR Puzzle Game with Blender, Unity and Oculus Rift. The game allows users to grab and assemble bones to educate them about the human skeletal system. In this project, we want to bring a new experience for players so that they can see the learning in a much more intriguing way.

# Future Work
In future work, we would like to complete the game by adding hints to help players when they get stuck. More information related to the bones would be useful in terms of learning. Besides, we aim to explore other features such as **Top Score** to save the score of player and **Highlight** effect to make the pair of bones highlighted when the user assembles them correctly. It is also worth getting feedback from the players, especially medical students, to better understand their needs, which in turn helps us further improve the game for educational purpose.
